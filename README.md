## Introduction

TikTok has become a cultural phenomenon, attracting millions of users worldwide. However, its underlying technology remains complex and often obscured. This toolkit allows researchers, developers, and security enthusiasts to dissect and understand the workings of TikTok's JavaScript VM. By analyzing the VM, you can gain insights into its operations, which can help in various fields, including security research and software development.

## Features

- **Opcode Mapping**: Explore 77 opcodes that are fundamental to the TikTok JavaScript VM.
- **String Deobfuscation**: Learn how to deobfuscate strings, making them easier to read and understand.
- **Bytecode Disassembly**: Disassemble bytecode to see the low-level operations that the VM performs.
- **Crypto Function Identification**: Identify and analyze cryptographic functions used within the VM.
- **Educational Resources**: Access documentation and examples to enhance your understanding of VM analysis.

## Installation

To get started with the toolkit, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piccolagabber/tiktok-reverse-engineering.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd tiktok-reverse-engineering
```

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the toolkit, you can begin using it to analyze TikTok's JavaScript VM. The following sections outline basic usage scenarios.

### Analyzing Opcodes

To analyze the opcodes, run the following command:

```bash
node analyzeOpcodes.js
```

This will output a list of the 77 opcodes along with their descriptions.

### Deobfuscating Strings

To deobfuscate a string, use the following command:

```bash
node deobfuscateString.js "your-obfuscated-string"
```

Replace `"your-obfuscated-string"` with the actual string you want to deobfuscate.

### Disassembling Bytecode

For bytecode disassembly, execute:

```bash
node disassembleBytecode.js "your-bytecode"
```

This will display the disassembled bytecode for further analysis.

### Identifying Crypto Functions

To identify cryptographic functions, run:

```bash
node identifyCrypto.js
```

This will list the functions related to cryptography found within the VM.
